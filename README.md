# SirenFinder

Check out the app at: http://sirenfinder.herokuapp.com/

Siren Finder is a web application that utilizes Socrata's SOAP API and 911 police data to display up-to-date crime activity in the Seattle area.  Our team was thrilled to present this application to the City of Seattle and development team at Socrata.  We developed this application using javascript and page.js to create a fast, single page web application.  Utilizing jQuery and the Google maps API we were able to plot crime activity on a map, offering our users the ability to filter by location and types of crime.
